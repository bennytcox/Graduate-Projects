# üìä Benjamin Cox ‚Äì Graduate Coursework & Projects

This repository highlights selected assignments and projects from my **graduate coursework in Biostatistics and Data Science** at the University of Minnesota. Each folder contains project reports, source code, and analyses demonstrating advanced technical and analytical skills in **statistical inference, R programming, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and scientific communication**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### üîπ Biostatistics with R ‚Äì Postpartum Hemoglobin & Blood Loss Study

**Homework 1 (BIOSTAT I)**
* **Files**:
   * `Homework1code_BennyCox.R` ‚Äì R script performing exploratory data analysis on postpartum hemoglobin (`HbPost`) and blood loss (`TotalBloodLoss`) from an Argentinian study of 447 women. Includes histograms, mean/median, standard deviation, range, and quartile summaries.
   * `Homework1analysis_BennyCox.pdf` ‚Äì Formal write-up with tables of summary statistics and interpretation. Emphasizes robust vs non-robust measures of center/spread (median vs mean, SD vs IQR/range)
   * `Homework1presentation_BennyCox.pdf` ‚Äì Slide-style summary for a non-technical audience highlighting why monitoring blood loss and hemoglobin is important postpartum
* **Key Demonstrations**:
   * Ability to perform EDA in R (histograms, summary statistics)
   * Statistical reasoning: recognizing when mean/SD vs. median/IQR are appropriate based on skewness
   * Communication: translating technical results into accessible conclusions about maternal health risks

**Homework 2 (BIOSTAT I)**
* **Files**:
   * `Homework2code_BennyCox.R` ‚Äì R script using `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` for data cleaning, visualization, and inferential statistics. Conducts one-sample t-tests to test if average postpartum blood loss exceeds 500 mL, and computes confidence intervals.
   * `Homework2analysis_BennyCox.pdf` ‚Äì Written report with histograms, summary tables, and formal hypothesis test results. Shows CLT justification, null/alternative hypotheses, p-value, and confidence interval interpretation
   * `Homework2presentation_BennyCox.pdf` ‚Äì Condensed slides summarizing the test results: average blood loss ‚âà 385 mL, not statistically greater than 500 mL
* **Key Demonstrations**:
   * Applied statistical inference in R (t-tests, CI estimation)
   * Validation of assumptions via Central Limit Theorem
   * Effective scientific communication through both technical reports and presentation slides
